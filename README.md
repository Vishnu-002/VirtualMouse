# VirtualMouse_
A virtual mouse is a project that allows a user to control the cursor on a computer screen using hand gestures or body movements, rather than a physical mouse.
It typically uses computer vision algorithms to track the movement of the user's hand or body, and then maps those movements to corresponding cursor movements on the screen.
